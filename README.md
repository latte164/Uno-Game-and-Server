# Uno-Game-and-Server
Uno game clone and companion server for multiplayer coded in Java and Processing 3 (graphics-focused Java library)

The server is executed with the "java UnoServerMain 8192" command. "8192" is the predetermined port; if you wish to change this you must also change the port on line 6 in the game code's "Client" file. Also, if you would like to play outside of a lan environment, the ip must be changed as well in the  "Client" file.
